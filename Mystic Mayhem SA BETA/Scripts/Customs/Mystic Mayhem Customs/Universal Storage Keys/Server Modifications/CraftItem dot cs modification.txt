/*---------------------------------------------------- BaseStoreKey crafting BEGIN-----------------------------------

This block allows the craft system to check and withdraw resources from any BaseStoreKey or MasterKey objects found within the
crafter's backpack.  

Location: This block belongs in CraftItem.cs under Scripts\Engines\Craft\Core\. This block needs to be inserted in the main ConsumeRes
method within the block that reads "if ( ourPack.GetBestGroupAmount( types[i], true, new CheckItemGroup( CheckHueGrouping ) ) < amounts[i] ) {"
In an unmodified server, this can be found on line 749, so insertion should begin on line 751


Installation: drop this block in place, being mindful of the structure around it

							//perform a scan and withdraw of the requested resource if it is found.  If not, then let the standard
