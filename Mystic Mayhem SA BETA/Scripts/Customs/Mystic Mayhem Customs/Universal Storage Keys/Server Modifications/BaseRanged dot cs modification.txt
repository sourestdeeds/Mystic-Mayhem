/*---------------------------------------------------- BaseStoreKey ammo BEGIN-----------------------------------
This block allows the ranged weapon system to check and withdraw ammo from any BaseStoreKey or MasterKey objects found within the
archer's backpack.  

Location: This block belongs in BaseRanged.cs under Scripts\Items\Weapons\Ranged\. This block needs to be inserted in the OnFired() 
event callback method, and it needs to replace the following line:

			if ( attacker.Player && (pack == null || !pack.ConsumeTotal( AmmoType, 1 )) )
				return false;

On an unmodified server, this is found on or around line 102 of BaseRanged.cs


Installation: remove the two lines of code listed above, and drop this in its place

			//only consume ammo if you're a player - monster archers have unlimited ammo
			if ( attacker.Player )
			{
				//if they don't have a backpack, or they don't have arrows/bolts in their pack, or they dont have arrows/bolts in
				//their keys, then return false
