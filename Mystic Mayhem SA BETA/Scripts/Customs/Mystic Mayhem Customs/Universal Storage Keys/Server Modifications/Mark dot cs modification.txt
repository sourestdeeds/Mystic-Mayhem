/*---------------------------------------------------- BaseStoreKey mark BEGIN-----------------------------------

This block allows the spell system to check and withdraw a recall rune from any BaseStoreKey or MasterKey objects found within the
caster's backpack.  

Location: This block belongs in Mark.cs under Scripts\Spells\Sixth\. This block needs to be inserted in the OnCast method
of class MarkSpell, as the first line after the { curly bracket. On an unmodified server, this is around line 28 of Mark.cs

Installation: drop this block in place, being mindful of the structure around it
